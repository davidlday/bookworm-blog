While this was a fun little project, I’ve moved on. Some work from this
experiment has been reused in a set of Python projects under my
[ProseGrinder](https://github.com/prosegrinder) organization on GitHub. I’ve
shifted my focus, however, from trying to use stats for matching stories with
markets to just providing stats for others to do their own analysis on prose.
